  <p>Welcome to my site about my coding journey. Along this journey I have learned some new skills that I enjoy using.
    The reason I began this journey was to be able to spend time with my family and learn skills to create new and fun
    experiences with my two boys and later my daughter as well. Throughout my site you will find some examples of the
    different skills I have learned and fun things I have made by using them. I would have to say my favorite so far has
    been learning about CSS and how to use it for customizing my site to look the best.</p>
  <p> Soon, on my site I will be creating a blog showing things that I make to demonstrate the skills I learn throughout
    the remainder of the course. If you are interested in seeing more of the skills I have you can follow the link <a
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielgraham91/" target="_blank">here</a> to view my LinkedIn profile.If you are
    interested in following my journey to learn new coding abilities please visit the blog page, or to see them used on some of the prjects I'm creating, please visit the portfolio page to see a few of my recently completed projects.
