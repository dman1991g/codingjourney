  <p align="center">My coding Journey</p>
  <p> I'm starting a blog to talk about this journey through my time spent learning coding and as you can see by viewing my projects tab, I have learned so much already that I didn't know when I started. This will be a long journey ,but hopefully everyone will stay along for the ride.</p>
  <p>I'm getting ready to start week 4 of the class and I already feel I have learned so much in the short amount of time. I have become able to build full web pages as well as having the ability to add different styles to them using a few different methods. I have also learned how to add images and even change the appearance based on what kind of device is being used to view the site.</p>
  <p> In the coming days I will be adding more to the project section to display the different ways I have learned to edit parts of the pages. If you would like to see them feel free to click the project tab above. Please stay along for this journey as I feel that what is displayed at the end will be worth the time!
