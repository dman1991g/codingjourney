  <h1 align="center">My coding Journey</h1>
  <p> I'm starting this blog as a way to talk about this journey through my time spent learning coding and as you can see by viewing my portfolio tab, I have learned so much already that I didn't know when I started. This will be a long journey ,but the knowledge I will gotten by the end will be worth it.</p><br>
  <p> As I reach the halfway point of the class and I already feel I have learned so much in the short amount of time. I have become able to build full web pages using several different skills as well as having the ability to add different styles and functionality to them using a few different methods such as CSS and Javascript. I have also learned how to add media to the site and even change the appearance based on the device being used to view each site I create.</p><br>
  <p> In the coming days I will be adding different projects to the portfolio section to display the different things I have learned to create. If you would like to view them you can do so by clicking on the portfolio tab above.</p>
